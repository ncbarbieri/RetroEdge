# RetroEdge - Retro Educational Development Game Engine

RetroEdge is a lightweight 2D game engine designed with educational goals in mind. It provides a simple yet modern framework to help students learn the core concepts of game development without being overwhelmed by technical complexity.

Built using up-to-date practices such as the Entity Component System (ECS) architecture, delta time calculation, and event-driven interactions, RetroEdge guides students through the creation of an action RPG (ARPG) from the ground up. The lessons cover essential topics including sprite animation, tilemaps, collision detection, sound integration, UI design, pathfinding (A* and Jump Point Search), and combat mechanics.

Project Goals:

- **Simplicity first**: Prioritize clean and easy-to-understand code to make game development accessible to beginners.
- **Modern techniques**: Apply industry-standard practices such as ECS, state machines, and real-time rendering.
- **Step-by-step learning**: Offer a lesson-based structure that gradually introduces new concepts.
- **Hands-on projects**: Allow students to build their own ARPG game while learning foundational programming and game design skills.
- **Advanced Java practice**: Provide a structured environment for practicing advanced Java concepts, including multithreading, object-oriented design, and collection frameworks.
- **Complex project management**: Help students gain experience working on a modular, multi-class codebase similar to real-world software projects.

RetroEdge is ideal for high school students approaching game development for the first time.
